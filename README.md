##About @dogepricebot
@dogepricebot is a automated twitter bot that scrapes dogecoin and Bitcoin pricing data from multiple exchanges, averages the data, and tweets it back on an hourly basis.

It's a fun and easy way to stay on top of DOGE and BTC price movements!

###Exchanges supported:
+ BTC-e
+ BTER
+ CoinedUp
+ Cryptsy
+ More on the way!

###What to expect:
I plan to expand @dogepricebot's functionality to be more interactive. Soon,
people will be able to use @dogepricebot like a currency conversion calculator,
using the following syntax:

    `@dogepricebot convert XXXX DOGE to USD`  

Should yield the following output:  

    `@twitter_user such convert: XXXX #DOGE = $Y.YY USD #dogepricebot`

That's the plan for now. I also plan to expand to EURO support.
